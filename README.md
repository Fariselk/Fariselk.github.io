Using HTML and CSS, I created a responsive static website called Venus Beans, a fictitious space company that sells coffee beans. Included within are tables, forms and mobile first web design,

Here is the link to the website repository link: https://github.com/Fariselk/Fariselk.github.io and the website link: https://fariselk.github.io
